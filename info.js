console.log("WARNING!")
console.log("Now obviously this is where I would give you a warning. Obviously I'm not going to because there's no account to steal, no info to get from you, so leave it be! But honestly, don't paste any scipts in here unless you know what they do. If someone says \'This script gives you free money OMG!\' obviously don't believe them. Verify that for yourself. And that means that if you have no programming knowledge than don't use this. So in the end, I'm basically saying the same thing I would have if there was an account to steal. So if you have no programming knowledge than get out of the console.")

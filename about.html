    <h2>Why do I need an about page?</h2>
    <p>It's quite simple really. SpeedcubeConference might be an event that seems basic. Even if you've been there. If not, I'm sure you can imagine it. So why? Because of our founding. The event was something unseen before, and we were the first. It was just a normal weekend, and I was bored. So I decided that I would hold an online competition for cubing, which was a very popular thing in our class. We spent a week setting it up, and it was very hard. In the end, it came out pretty well. I decided to hold them weekly, and we had lots of fun. We even made a website for it. It was on Google Sites, because I didn't know much better. I had taken a lot of programming classes, so I used that knowledge because it gives more freedoms to make stuff. After that, the idea exploded. People starting making websites and contests all around. I was happy to see that our idea had taken off. Then, I went to Github, because I had an interest in programming, and that leads us to today. Thank you for all the support!</p>
